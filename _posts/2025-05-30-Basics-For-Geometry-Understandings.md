## Basics for Understanding Geometry Operations

Understanding projections, intersections and other operations you need a solid understanding of basic Geometric algebra topics, you already forget (i talk about me of course).

Here is a list of fundamentals you need later on:
- Understanding of sin, cos, tan in triangles: https://www.cimt.org.uk/projects/mepres/step-up/sect4/index.htm
- Dot Product: https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/dot-product/
- Normalization: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations/programming-vectors/a/vector-magnitude-normalization#:~:text=To%20normalize%20a%20vector%2C%20therefore,is%20called%20a%20unit%20vector.
